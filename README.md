# Twitter Mentors

This is a small script that crawls replies to [@sehurlburt](https://twitter.com/sehurlburt)'s tweet about mentorship and indexes the mentors.

## Running Yourself
You need to have [Python Twitter Tools](https://github.com/sixohsix/twitter/tree/master) and Python YAML package installed. 

If these are present, just create a config file `twitter-config.yml` in same folder as `twitter-mentors.py` and run the `twitter-mentors.py` file.
